## Premise

Buy My Beer is an endpoint for your CI server.  You register your project and
it set up a post-build hook.

Each failed build "costs" the breaking committer one beer.  Eventually the team
accumulates enough beer to go out and have a round together.

### Minimal Features

* Easy login and setup!  Just use your GitHub credentials if you have them.

* Spend your failure!  Alerts on your team's total beers, so you know when it's
time to go out together.

* Plan an event at a location convenient for everyone.


### Possible Features

* Beer price points.
* Configurable thresholds for events.
* Broken branches cost beer too!
* Location monitoring in case other teams in your area are going out too, drink together!
